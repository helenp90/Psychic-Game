	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>
			Amy Winehouse was an English singer and songwriter. Her music was known for being an eclectic mix of soul, rythm and blues, and jazz. In 2003 she released her first album "Frank", and was critically acclaimed in the UK, and nominated for the Mercury Prize. Her second album, "Back to Black" followed in 2006- this album won her 5 grammy awards in 2008.
		</p>
		<p>
			Her influence comes from her family. Many of Winehouse's maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians. Amy's paternal grandmother, Cynthia, was a singer and dated the English jazz saxophonist Ronnie Scott. She and Amy's parents influenced Amy's interest in jazz. Her father, Mitch, often sang Frank Sinatra songs to her, and whenever she got chastised at school, she would sing "Fly Me to the Moon" before going up to the headmistress to be told off.
